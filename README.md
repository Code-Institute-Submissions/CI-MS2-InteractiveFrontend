# Code Institute Milestone 2
## Interactive Frontend Development

This project uses jQuery and Bootstrap for a minor website. Majgull Axelsson is a swedish author and a family member of mine. I have worked at the family company handling social media and general IT in the past. Majgull has decided she does not want a social media presence, but a website to present her work and offer an easy means of contact with her readers and events-bookers is still advantageous to her career and the family business.

### Known bugs currently (29/5/2020):

Contact sheet on contact.html is not yet integrated with EmailJS service and is not yet functional

Problems executing bookLoader.js in contact.html when it is called as an external file.

#### Updates (1/5/2020)

Contact.html is now fully functional. Will add confirmation dialogue soon.

bookLoader.js is now functional. It wasn't executing properly due to having "javascript" as its type in the html element.

#### Updates (9/6/2020)

Contact.html now confirms succesful sends and errors as intended.

Finished data-entry for books.json and finished bookLoader.js and /en/books.html to make it fully functional as intended, including animations. It unfortunately meant this commit was quite large, but the majority of those changes are adding image-assets.

#### Updates (10/6/2020):

Wrote and prototyped loadCalEvents.js, which calls on event resources from Google Calendar.
