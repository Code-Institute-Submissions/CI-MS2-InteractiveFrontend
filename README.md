# Code Institute Milestone 2
## Interactive Frontend Development

This project uses jQuery and Bootstrap for a minor website. Majgull Axelsson is a swedish author and a family member of mine. I have worked at the family company handling social media and general IT in the past. Majgull has decided she does not want a social media presence, but a website to present her work and offer an easy means of contact with her readers and events-bookers is still advantageous to her career and the family business.

### Known bugs currently (29/5/2020):

Contact sheet on contact.html is not yet integrated with EmailJS service and is not yet functional

Problems executing bookLoader.js in contact.html when it is called as an external file.
